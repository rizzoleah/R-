# 7.2.3 Other file types

# read_csv2() reads semicolon-separated files. These use ; instead of , to separate fields and are common in countries that use , as the decimal marker.
# 
# read_tsv() reads tab-delimited files.
# 
# read_delim() reads in files with any delimiter, attempting to automatically guess the delimiter if you donâ€™t specify it.
# 
# read_fwf() reads fixed-width files. You can specify fields by their widths with fwf_widths() or by their positions with fwf_positions().
# 
# read_table() reads a common variation of fixed-width files where columns are separated by white space.
# 
# read_log() reads Apache-style log files.
